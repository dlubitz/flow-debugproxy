Flow Framework Debug Proxy for xDebug
-------------------------------------

Flow Framework is a web application platform enabling developers creating
excellent web solutions and bring back the joy of coding. It gives you fast
results. It is a reliable foundation for complex applications.

The biggest pain with Flow Framework come from the the proxy class, the
framework do not execute your own code, but a precompiled version. This is
required for advanced feature, like AOP and the security framework. So working
with Flow is a real pleasure, but adding xDebug in the setup can be a pain.

This project is an xDebug proxy, written in Go, to take care of the mapping
between your PHP file and the proxy class.

--------------

    # Get the dependecies
    go get
    # Build
    go Build

Run the proxy
-------------

    # Don't forget to change the configuration of your IDE to use port 9010
    flow-debugproxy -vv --framework flow

How to debug the proxy class directly
-------------------------------------

protocol:

    ./flow-debugproxy --framework dummy
